    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Intro</h2>
        <p>
            Muslims, like many other groups, are generalized. Avoiding the largely controversial things that are talked about, fasting is one of the<br>
          things that are criticized. People claim that fasting is essentially starving yourself, but they don't realize the numerous health benefits of fasting.<br>
          Fasting is abstaining from food and drink from sunset to sundown. This is often recognized as an essential part of the religion Islam,<br>
          but it is important in many other things as well. In Western medical practices, fasting is often prescribed to people with a variety<br>
          of different illnesses, diabetes being a common one. However, sometimes, when fasting is prescribed, it is often done so in several <br>
          variants matching that specific person's needs. For example, it could be only abstaining from only food and not drink because that person<br>
          has a dehydration problem. Despite this, it is loaded with several different benefits under the classifications of: physical, spiritual, and <br>
          religious.

      <h3>The Spiritual Side</h3>
        <p>
          Fasting is full of benefits, and isn't harmful contrary to the popular belief. In Islam, it is a pillar and a mandatory action.<br>
          Even besides the Islamic and physical benefits, there are several spiritual benefits that build character. The first is to be <br>
          able to relate to the poor and people less fortunate than you. When you fast, you feel the same struggle that they go through<br>
          except they may not have the same luxury of Iftar (the breaking of the fast) that you have. Though it is human nature to feel <br>
          for others, you will never truely understand until you put yourself in their position. Fasting is exactly that. It will encourage<br>
          you to more for them. This leads to unity in the community. The month of Ramadan, which is the month where Muslims fast, is a month <br>
          where the entire community is brought together. Everyone is in the state of fasting, regardless of class. This sense of unity <br>
          combined with the fact that you will relate to those who are less fortunate leads to humility. You will learn to look down, not <br>
          up.

    <h3>The Islamic Side</h3>
    <p>
      
        Since fasting is a fundamental aspect of practicing Islam, there are always going to be benefits in the afterlife. Firstly, those <br>
      spritiual benefits discussed earlier that bring humility and relation to the poor are both important in Islam. Humility in Islam<br>
      is important as it says in the Quran, the holy book of the Muslims, that anyone with a mustard seed's weight of pride in their heart<br>
      will not enter Jannah (heaven). Fasting is a form of Jihad. This word has been thrown around by the media as a synonym for terrorism,<br>
      but it actually means a struggle for the sake of Allah (God). Despite your co-workers, classmates, and colleagues all eating beside you,<br>
      you hold true to your beliefs.

    <h3>The Scientific Side</h3>
    <p>
      Fasting also has benefits backed by science. People with genetic diabetes have a problem where their body resists insulin, which is <br>
      essentially the key into your cells that allows the glucose, or sugar, to enter. People whose bodies reject insulin often have sugar buildup<br>
      in their blood. Research shows that fasting helps increase your body's sensitivity to insulin. Fasting is similar to an internal cleanse.<br>
      Not only does it cleanse your body of toxins, it fights infections as well. This greatly reduces the risk of inflammation. The cleansing<br>
      is also a good and natural way to recover from any type of substance addiction. Fasting is also prescribed for people suffering from obesity,<br>
      as it reduces your calorie intake and boosts your metabolism. Studies show that intermittent fasting over the course of three months results in <br>
      a 16% decrease in body fat.

  <h3>The Mental Side</h3>
  <p>
   For this benifit, most research comes from animal testing, but it is found that the results are largely the same in humans. Fasting has a strong effect<br>
    on mental health. On a study on mice that lasted for 11 months, the results showed that intermittant fasting resulted in greatly increased min functionality<br>
    and strucure. Fasting also boosts the nerve cell production which results in enhanced mind fucntion. The aforementioned anti-inflammatory properties of fasting<br>
also aid in stopping neurodegenerative disorders. Specific examples include Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
