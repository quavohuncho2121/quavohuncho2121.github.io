        <p>
          Fasting is full of benefits, and isn't harmful contrary to the popular belief. In Islam, it is a pillar and a mandatory action.<br>
          Even besides the Islamic and physical benefits, there are several spiritual benefits that build character. The first is to be <br>
          able to relate to the poor and people less fortunate than you. When you fast, you feel the same struggle that they go through<br>
          except they may not have the same luxury of Iftar (the breaking of the fast) that you have. Though it is human nature to feel <br>
          for others, you will never truely understand until you put yourself in their position. Fasting is exactly that. It will encourage<br>
          you to more for them. This leads to unity in the community. The month of Ramadan, which is the month where Muslims fast, is a month <br>
          where the entire community is brought together. Everyone is in the state of fasting, regardless of class. This sense of unity <br>
          combined with the fact that you will relate to those who are less fortunate leads to humility. You will learn to look down, not <br>
          up.
