        Since fasting is a fundamental aspect of practicing Islam, there are always going to be benefits in the afterlife. Firstly, those <br>
      spritiual benefits discussed earlier that bring humility and relation to the poor are both important in Islam. Humility in Islam<br>
      is important as it says in the Quran, the holy book of the Muslims, that anyone with a mustard seed's weight of pride in their heart<br>
      will not enter Jannah (heaven). Fasting is a form of Jihad. This word has been thrown around by the media as a synonym for terrorism,<br>
      but it actually means a struggle for the sake of Allah (God). Despite your co-workers, classmates, and colleagues all eating beside you,<br>
      you hold true to your beliefs.
