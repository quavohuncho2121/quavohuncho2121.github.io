      Fasting also has benefits backed by science. People with genetic diabetes have a problem where their body resists insulin, which is <br>
      essentially the key into your cells that allows the glucose, or sugar, to enter. People whose bodies reject insulin often have sugar buildup<br>
      in their blood. Research shows that fasting helps increase your body's sensitivity to insulin. Fasting is similar to an internal cleanse.<br>
      Not only does it cleanse your body of toxins, it fights infections as well. This greatly reduces the risk of inflammation. The cleansing<br>
      is also a good and natural way to recover from any type of substance addiction. Fasting is also prescribed for people suffering from obesity,<br>
      as it reduces your calorie intake and boosts your metabolism. Studies show that intermittent fasting over the course of three months results in <br>
      a 16% decrease in body fat.
