  <p>
   For this benifit, most research comes from animal testing, but it is found that the results are largely the same in humans. Fasting has <br>
    a strong effect on mental health. On a study on mice that lasted for 11 months, the results showed that intermittant fasting resulted <br>
    in greatly increased functionality and strucure. Fasting also boosts the nerve cell production which results in enhanced mind fucntion. <br>
    The aforementioned anti-inflammatory properties of fasting also aid in stopping neurodegenerative disorders. Specific examples include <br>
    Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
